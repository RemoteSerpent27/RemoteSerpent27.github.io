        The aroma of brewing coffee filled the quiet kitchen, a comforting scent that signaled the start of a new day. Outside, the morning light filtered through a curtain of mist, casting a gentle, ethereal glow over the dewy garden. A single robin landed on the windowsill, tilting its head as it watched the slow movements within the house, its tiny, dark eyes full of curiosity. The only other sound was the soft ticking of a grandfather clock in the next room, a steady and familiar rhythm that marked the passage of time. This quiet, peaceful scene was a small, perfect moment of stillness before the day's busy rhythm began to unfold.</p>
